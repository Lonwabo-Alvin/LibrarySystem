# Reflection: Challenges in Balancing Stakeholder Needs

During this assignment, I faced several challenges in balancing the conflicting needs of different stakeholders. 
For example, while the librarians focused on having an efficient book checkout system, the IT support staff prioritized system stability and security.
This required prioritizing performance optimizations that would also ensure the system’s security without introducing significant delays.
One of the key difficulties was ensuring that the system could handle both scalability and performance, especially during peak usage times, such as during exams when many students are likely to check out books.
Balancing this with security concerns was an ongoing challenge, but ultimately, I had to make trade-offs and prioritize the system’s essential functionalities, such as fast search results and secure user data.

Overall, communication and clear documentation were essential in understanding stakeholder priorities and ensuring their concerns were addressed in the system requirements.
