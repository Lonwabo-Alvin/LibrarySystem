# **Kanban board**

A Kanban board is a visual project management tool that tracks tasks across different workflow stages.
It helps Agile teams by:

Visualizing Workflow: Columns represent task progress from "To Do" to "Done".

Limiting Work-in-Progress (WIP): Ensures team members are not overloaded.

Supporting Agile Principles: Enables continuous delivery and adaptability.

# **How Our Kanban Board Helps**:

Task Visualization: Each column shows the status of different tasks.

Work-in-Progress Limits: Only 3 active tasks per developer at a time.

Efficient Tracking: Issues automatically move based on progress updates.
