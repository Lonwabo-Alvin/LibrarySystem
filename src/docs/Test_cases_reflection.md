# ðŸ“Œ Reflection: Challenges in Use Case and Test Case Development

This assignment was about turning system requirements into use case diagrams and test cases.
One of the biggest challenges was making sure that all stakeholder concerns were properly represented.

### Understanding Actor Interactions
Creating the use case diagram helped me see how different users, like students and librarians, interact with the system.
For example, I had to make sure that a student searching for a book is connected to the library's inventory system so the search results are always accurate.

### Writing Accurate Test Cases
Some test cases were easy, like testing if a student can borrow a book, but others were more difficult.
Performance testing, like checking if the system can handle 1,000 searches at once, was tricky because I had to think about how the system would respond under heavy load. Security testing was also a challenge because I had to imagine scenarios where a user might try to change book records without permission.

### Keeping Everything Consistent
I also had to make sure that my test cases matched the functional requirements from Assignment 4.
If something was listed as a feature in the system, there needed to be a test case to make sure it worked correctly.

### Final Thoughts
This assignment helped me understand how users interact with the system and how to test if the system actually works.
Even though writing test cases was challenging, it showed me how important it is to check every part of a system before itâ€™s used in real life.
