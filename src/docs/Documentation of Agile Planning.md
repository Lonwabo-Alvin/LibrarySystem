# Reflection: Challenges in Agile Planning for Library Management System

Planning this sprint required making trade-offs between functionality, security, and usability.

### Prioritization Challenges
Choosing which features to implement first was difficult. 
Searching, borrowing, and returning books were clearly must-have features,
but functionalities like **tracking overdue books and report generation had to be postponed.

### Effort Estimation Difficulties
Assigning story points and estimated hours was challenging because some tasks, like searching for books, seemed simple but required indexing and fast retrieval. 
On the other hand, implementing encryption required extra security testing, increasing effort estimation.

### Aligning Agile with Stakeholder Needs
Although a library system must be user-friendly, we also needed to consider security and system performance. 
Balancing the needs of students, librarians, and IT staff** meant deciding what to build first.

### Final Thoughts
This process helped me understand the importance of incremental development in Agile. 
Breaking down tasks into manageable user stories ensured that we could build a minimum viable product while still leaving room for improvements in future sprints.
